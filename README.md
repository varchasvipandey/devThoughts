devthoughts, pronounced as Dev Thoughts is a simple technical thoughts sharing platform built on top of React 17 and Google Firebase. The idea behind this app was to curate small technical blogs to improve overall knowledge sharing on programming languages, frameworks and libraries. It is a single page application where you can post and interact with other posts by developers worldwide.

## Ideology behind the app

The app started because of a small LinkedIn challenge that I (Varchasvi) gave to myself. The challenge was to create a small yet powerful application where people can share their programming-related knowledge. Although I was able to create the MVP version in just 38 hours, I saw some potential in the application which pushed me further into adding some awesome features into it including authentication! Yes, you read it correctly, Initially, I was not planning to add any type of authentication. Then I decided to make it more professional and reliable so that, people who are seeking some knowledge and want to share some knowledge on one dedicated platform can get some real value out of it.

## The development process

The development process through which this app is going through is super flexible and reliable. The biggest fact about this application is hidden inside its node modules folder! You can check the package.json file to understand the secret! But, if you are not in a mood for such heavy lifting, allow me to share the secret.

Except for React and its required libraries which comes pre-installed when you run create-react-app, only styled-components, firebase and UUID were installed. No other dependencies as of now have been installed! No fancy date-time manipulators, no fancy pop-up modals, component libraries, transitions/animations packs or boilerplates were installed during the process. In fact, the text editor is also written by the developer only i.e. me ðŸ˜‰.
